### Description

DeathStar is a COOL puzzle/strategy game based off of an extremely popular calculator game. It can be quite challenging but is also VERY fun! The object of the game is to collect the 10 green orbs in each of the 10 levels. It may sound easy, but it's not! Check it out, you'll probably have fun!
